# # Introduction to Development

This is a simple terminal bat file developed by terminal code in windows system, so it can only run in Windows.

Originally, it was a batch file, but it was packaged into an exe file through Bat_To_Exe_Converter.


# # General function

It is an updatable tool that can start frpc, edit configuration files and download different versions of frpc.

Frp is a widely used intranet penetration tool with moderate performance, and it is completely open source in Github.

# # Function introduction

In 1.8.0 ChmlFrpLauncher can not only start ChmlFrpc, but also start the original frp.

In 1.8.3 ChmlFrpLauncher supports all languages, but you have to translate it yourself, just change it to a file prefix in the confing file.

ChmlFrpLauncher will find the corresponding file in the lang folder according to the character after lang= and the. lang suffix.

For example: ` lang = zh _ cn``` zh _ cn.lang`

In version 1.8.3, ChmlFrpLauncher will automatically check for updates, but it will have a certain impact on slow access to github.

A new page download related frpc and its configuration file has been added, so it is not necessary to use Gitee mirror download source for domestic download.

I am worried about the download problem, but I still use Github to detect the update download when updating. So far, I have not found a domestic substitute.
