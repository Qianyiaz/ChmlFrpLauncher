## Related Features
      
In version 1.8.0, ChmlFrpLauncher not only launches ChmlFrpc but also supports the original frp. 

In version 1.8.3, ChmlFrpLauncher supports all languages, but you need to translate yourself by modifying the prefix in the config file.
For example: Language file: `zh_cn.lang`       Configuration file: `lang=zh_cn`

A new page has been added to download relevant frpc and its configuration files. For users in China, you can use the Gitee mirror for downloads without worrying about download issues. However, when updating, it still uses GitHub to check for updates and downloads, as no domestic alternatives have been found yet.
